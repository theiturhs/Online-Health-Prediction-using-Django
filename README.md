# Online-Health-Prediction-using-Django

## Introduction

This project proposes **Django-based Online Health Prediction platform**. This platform utilizes machine learning models to provide online predictions for various health conditions, including **mental disorders, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and obesity**. These predictions stem from trained models using datasets sourced from **Kaggle**. In addition to offering predictive health analysis, the platform allows users to have the option to download their online health reports generated from the predictions. Moreover, they can conveniently schedule appointments with healthcare professionals by providing their contact details and sending messages directly through the platform. For healthcare professionals, the platform offers the capability to register and manage appointments. Doctors can view and accept appointment requests sent by users.

## Structure

Here is the breakdown of Django project structure:

* **predictHealth (Folder)**
  This is the main root directory of Django project. It contains manage.py file, which is the primary script for managing this Django application.

* **home (Folder):**
  This is a Django app. Django apps are reusable components that contain models, views, and other logic specific to a particular functionality.

* **static (Folder)**: This folder stores static files that are served directly by the web server without being processed by Django. This folder contains: 
  * CSS files, Images
  * CSV files: Dataset used for training models (source: kaggle)
  * encoders: Folder containing encoders for prediction models.
  * models for prediction: This folder contains saved models for prediction/
  * templates (Folder): This folder contains HTML template files.
  * requirements.txt: This file is for managing dependencies. It lists all the required Python packages and libraries needed for this project to function.

## Tech-Stack

* Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
* Backend: Python, Django, Sqlite3
